# Anomaly-Detection-In-Network-Traffic
An advanced machine learning-powered web application for detecting anomalies in network traffic using models like Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, CatBoost, and more — built with Streamlit.

## 🔐 Login Credentials

To access the system, please use the following demo credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`  
- **Password**: `admin123`

## 📂 Upload Format
Upload a **cleaned CSV file** similar to the preprocessed KDD dataset.
Use the sample below to test the system:

🔗 [Download Sample Dataset (`kddcup_clean.csv`)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhushbooBoolchandani/Anomaly-Detection-In-Network-Traffic/main/kddcup_clean.csv)

> Make sure your dataset includes features like:  
`duration, protocol_type, service, flag, src_bytes, dst_bytes, ...` etc

## 🔗 Run the App
Follow the installation steps below, then open your browser and go to:  
# Run the Streamlit app
Once you start the app using `streamlit run App.py`, open your browser and go to:
🔗 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
This will launch the app on your local system using Streamlit.
